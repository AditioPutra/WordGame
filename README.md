# WordGame
Babbel Coding challenge
8 hours were invested building the game, I used MVVM fo architecture.

How was the time distributed (concept, model layer, view(s), game mechanics)
1 hour setting up the project ( Creating project, localizableStrings).
0.5 hour on layout.
0.5 hour on creating parser and data loader to decode the data and mapping it to a usable struct to check if the provided model is the correct translation.
2.5 hours on setting the architecture (I've used MVVM to handling all the business logic in ViewModel).
1.5 hours on implementing the first deliverable logic
1 hour on adding unit tests + documentation

because of limitations I did not have time to make Unit Testing and UI Testing.

If I have more time I make unit tests, make the code more scalable and try to use SwiftUI (which I'm still learning at this point)
