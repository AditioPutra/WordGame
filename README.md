# WordGame
<br /> Babbel Coding challenge <br />

8 hours were invested building the game, I used MVVM fo architecture.
<br /> How was the time distributed (concept, model layer, view(s), game mechanics) <br />
<br /> 1 hour setting up the project ( Creating project, localizableStrings). <br />
<br /> 0.5 hour on layout. <br />
<br /> 0.5 hour on creating parser and data loader to decode the data and mapping it to a usable struct to check if the provided model is the correct translation. <br />
<br /> 2.5 hours on setting the architecture (I've used MVVM to handling all the business logic in ViewModel). <br />
<br /> 1.5 hours on implementing the first deliverable logic <br />
<br /> 1 hour on adding unit tests + documentation <br />
<br /> If I have more time I make UI Test, make the code more scalable and try to use SwiftUI (which I'm still learning at this point) <br />
<br /> make a better UI and Animation. <br />
<br /> Fix the problem because (Decision was made due to limited time). <br />
